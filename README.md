The functions below simulate cyclic voltammetry experiments using the method outlined in Brown, J. H. J. Chem. Educ. 2015, 92, 1490-1496 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225), and in Gosser, D. K. Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation and Analysis of Reaction Mechanisms, VCH, New York, 1993.

The functions in the script file **eChem_sim.R** simulate the results of cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and chronocoulometry experiments. Options exist for E, EC, and CE mechanisms.

The functions in the script file **eChem_plot.R** provide different options for plotting the results of a simulation, including the ability to compare several simulations, to annotate a single simulation, and a variety of ways to examine diffusion profiles.

The functions in the script file **eChem_animation.R** provide different options for creating GIF and HTML animations of a simulation.

The **eChem_test.R"** script file contains sample code to test the simulation functions; most of the examples duplicate figures from the literature.
