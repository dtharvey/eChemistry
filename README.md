The functions in the script file **eChem_sim.R** simulate the results of cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and chronocoulometry experiments. Options exist for E, EC, and CE mechanisms. The simulations use the method outlined in Brown, J. H. J. Chem. Educ. 2015, 92, 1490-1496 (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00225), and in Gosser, D. K. Cyclic Voltammetry Simulation and Analysis of Reaction Mechanisms, VCH, New York, 1993, which are extended to other experiments.

The functions in the script file **eChem_plot.R** provide different options for plotting the results of a simulation, including the ability to compare several simulations, to annotate a single simulation, and a variety of ways to examine diffusion profiles.

The functions in the script file **eChem_animation.R** provide different options for creating GIF and HTML animations of a simulation.

The **eChem_test.R"** script file contains sample code to test the simulation functions; most of the examples duplicate figures from the literature.
